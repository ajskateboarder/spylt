# spylt

**Spylt (*spilt*)** is a full-stack web framework which simplifies backend development and frontend development. Simple Python functions can be turned into web APIs which can be directly called from Svelte code **under a single codebase.**  

No directory structure is forced, making Spylt very unopinionated and scalable when organizing code.

## Why?

Normally, if you wanted to combine an API and a frontend framework, you would have to separate the apps into different codebases and different repositories. 

The ideal solution would be to simply store frontend code in a single application, similar to how classic SSR sites work. Instead of storing HTML pages however, it would have Svelte pages, which allow for better modularity and more reactivity. 

**This is your solution.**
